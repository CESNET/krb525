KRB525 INSTALLATION
-------------------

Installing the Client

  The client program, krb525, can be installed anywhere but typically
  in the bin subdirectory of your krb5 installation tree
  (e.g. /krb5/bin) is a good place.

  In order to contact the daemon it will look in /etc/services for a
  "krb525" service and will use that as a port to contact the
  daemon. If this entry is not present it will fall back to using port
  6565 (tcp).

Installing the Daemon

  Install the daemon in your krb5 sbin directory. It expects to be run
  out of inetd so add the following line to your /etc/services:

  krb525            6565/tcp

  Then add the following line to your /etc/inetd.conf and restart your
  inetd daemon:

  krb525   stream    tcp  nowait    root /krb5/sbin/krb525d  krb525d

  You will need to create a principal of the form "krb525/<hostname>"
  for each host that krb525d is running on. It is suggest that the
  daemons run on each of your Kerberos KDCs, by default that is where
  the client will try to contact the daemon. The key for this
  principal should be added to the keytab on each machine where the
  daemons are running.

  krb525d will log all errors and events to syslog under the facility
  daemon. In order to diagnoise problems and do auditing you want to
  check your syslogd configuration to make sure this information is
  going somewhere useful.

Installing the Configuration File

  Before the daemon will do anything you need to create the
  krb525.conf configuration file. By default krb525d will look for
  this file in the etc subdirectory of your krb5 installation tree
  (e.g. /krb5/etc/krb525.conf), but you can specify this when krb525d
  is run with the "-c <filename>" option.

  For full details on what krb525.conf whould look like see the man
  page for krb525.conf(5). A real basic krb525.conf will look like:

  #
  # Basic krb525.conf
  #

  allowed_hosts =
    hosta.domain.com
    hostb.domain.com
  ;

  allowed_clients =
    client1@DOMAIN.COM
  ;

  client_mappings = {
    client1@DOMAIN.COM = client2@DOMAIN.COM
  }

  The above example allows the principal client1 to connect from
  either the hosts hosta or hostb and to convert their tickets to
  those of client2.

RUNNING KRB525

Ok, assuming you have everything installed as specified above, let's
say you have a ticket for client1@DOMAIN.COM:

% klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_console
Default principal: client1@DOMAIN.COM

Valid starting      Expires             Service principal
25 Sep 97 08:41:27  26 Sep 97 09:41:27  krbtgt/DOMAIN.COM@DOMAIN.COM
%

Now let's say you wanted to convert that ticket into a ticket for
client2@DOMAIN.COM. You would run krb525, specifing "-C
client2". (Specifying "-v" tells krb525 to be verbose).

% krb525 -C client2 -v
Initializing Kerberos
Ticket to convert is client1@DOMAIN.COM for krbtgt/DOMAIN.COM@DOMAIN.COM
Target ticket is client2@DOMAIN.COM for krbtgt/DOMAIN.COM@DOMAIN.COM
Trying to connect to krb525d on kerberos.domain.com port 6565
Connected to kerberos.ncsa.uiuc.edu
Getting credentials for krb525d (client1@DOMAIN.COM for krb525/domain.com@DOMAIN.COM) 
Authenticating...
sendauth succeeded
New ticket read from server. Storing in /tmp/krb5cc_console

%

Now doing a klist shows you have the converted credentials:
% klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_console
Default principal: client2@DOMAIN.COM

Valid starting      Expires             Service principal
25 Sep 97 08:41:27  26 Sep 97 09:41:27  krbtgt/DOMAIN.COM@DOMAIN.COM
%

Notice that the ticket really has been converted and not acquired
anew. All the original attributes of the ticket are retained.

If any error occurs krb525 will return a rather vague and unhelpful
error. This is intentional to prevent a potential hacker from gaining
too much information about the contents of the krb525.conf file. To
determine what the real problem is you need to check the syslog
information of the host where krb525d is running.
