.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb525
converts a Kerberos 5 ticket for
.B client
and
.B server
to a ticket for
.B target_client
and
.BR target_server .
.I krb525
has three intended uses. The first is to allow users who are coming in
from anothr realm to get tickets for their principals in the local
realm so that the can access services that don't respect the Kerberos 5
.k5login file. The second use is for a Kerberos-su utility that allows
authorized users to get tickets for other clients as needed. The third
is to allow users to acquire Kerberos credentials after they have
been authenticated by some other means besides Kerberos.
.PP
krb525 does this conversion by sending the encrypted ticket over to a
daemon, krb525d(8), via an encrypted channel. The daemon either must
running on the Kerberos KDC or have access to a keytab with the
relevant service keys. The daemon does the needed decryption,
principal conversion and re-encryption of the ticket before sending it
back the
.I krb525
client. The configuration file for the daemon,
krb525.conf(5), control which principal conversion are permissable.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
specifies that krb525 should run the aklog program. See the section on
RUNNING AKLOG below for details.
.TP
.B \-A
specifies that krb525 should not run the aklog program. See the section on
RUNNING AKLOG below for details.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIclient\fP
specifies the initial client principal name on the ticket sent to
krb525d(8) for conversion be
.IR client .
By default this is the default principal of the current credentials cache.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP \fItarget_client\fP
specifies the target client in the new ticket be
.IR target_client .
By default this will be the principal with the same name as the
current user running the process. This allows someone who has just
logged in from another realm and currently has a ticket for
user@OTHERREALM.COM to get a ticket for user@LOCALREALM.COM.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP \fIserver_host\fP
specifes the host to context the krb525d(8) daemon on. Be default 
.I krb525
will try all the KDCs for the local realm listed in the krb5.conf(5)
file.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIinput_cache\fP
specifies the cache to get the credentials file from be
.IR input_cache .
By default it will be the current user's default cache.
.TP
.B \-k
specifies that the initial credentials should be obtained using the
keytab file. This requires that the \fB\-c\fP option be specifies to
indicate the client principal name.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIoutput_cache\fP
specifies that the resulting credentials be stored in
.IRoutput_cache .
By default they will be stored in the user's default cache or in the 
.I input_cache
if that was specified (\fB\-i\fP).
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIserver_port\fP
specifies the port number on which to try to contact the krb525d(8)
server. By default
.I krb525
will try the service "krb525" as specified in /etc/services(4). If a
krb525 entry is not present it will fall back to port 6565.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIservice\fP
specifies the service principal name on the ticket sent to krb525d(8)
for conversion be
.IR service .
By default the service will be the Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket
service for the local realm.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fItarget_service\fP
specifies the target serivce in the new ticket should be
.IR target_service .
By default the service will be unchanged and this will be the same as
.IR service .
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIkeytab_file\fP
specifies the keytab file to be used is
.IR keytab_file .
Note that the 
.B -k
option must be specified for this to be meaningful.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP \fItimeout\fP
specifies the TCP connection timeout in seconds. Must be greater then 0.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP \fIuser\fP
specifies the owner of the resulting credentials file should be
.IR user .
.TP
.B \-v
specifies that
.I krb525
should run in verbose mode. This can be handy for debugging.
.TP
.B \-V
specifies that
.I krb525
should print it's version number and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example say you are user vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU and you have
just logged into a machine in the realm NCSA.EDU. The .k5login in
~vwelch had an entry for vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU so you are able to log
in just fine. Assuming you forwarded your tickets your cache will now
look like:

.nf
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_p29962
Default principal: vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU

Valid starting      Expires             Service principal
24 Sep 97 15:19:40  25 Sep 97 01:19:35  krbtgt/TEST.NCSA.EDU@TEST.NCSA.EDU
24 Sep 97 15:19:41  25 Sep 97 01:19:35  krbtgt/NCSA.EDU@TEST.NCSA.EDU
.fi

So although you have a krbtgt for the realm NCSA.EDU, it is for the
client vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU and not NCSA.EDU. Normally this would not
make a difference since you have the principal vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU
mapped to vwelch@NCSA.EDU in your .k5login.
.PP
But say you needed to
access a service that did not respect the .k5login file, then you
would need a ticket for vwelch@NCSA.EDU. You could run kinit(1) and
enter the password for vwelch@NCSA.EDU, but this won't work for
situations that don't allow for user input. In this case assuming the
krb525d has been given the appropriate client mapping that
vwelch@TEST.NCSA.EDU = vwelch@NCSA.EDU you can run krb525 and have it
convert your ticket to one for vwelch@NCSA.EDU.
.PP
For example:

.nf
% ./krb525 -v

.fi
.SH TICKET OPTIONS
If you are getting your ticket to convert from a cache, then the
converted ticket will have the same ticket options (e.g. forwardable,
lifetime) as the initial ticket.
.PP
If you are using a keytab file to get a ticket to convert, then
.I krb525
will automatically make the acquired ticket forwardable.
.PP
Currently there is no way to have
.I krb525
set different options. If you need to change the options, you should run
kinit(1) on the ticket to do so.
.SH RUNNING AKLOG
If your Kerberos 5 installation has the AFS-KRB5 migration kit
installed and krb525 was built to take advantage of this, then krb525
can run the  
.I aklog
program after converting the ticket.
.I krb525
will look in the krb5.conf(5) file for a entry like the following:
.nf

[appdefaults]
	krb5_run_aklog = 1
	krb5_aklog_path = /krb5/bin/aklog

.fi
The value for krb5_run_aklog specifies wther aklog should be run
(run_aklog = 1) or should not be run (run_aklog = 0). The string
specified by krb5_aklog_path is used as the path for the aklog
program.
.PP
The command line options
.B \-a 
and
.B \-A
can override the krb5_run_aklog value in krb5.conf. If
.B \-a
is specified, krb525 will always try to run aklog. If
.B \-A
is specified then krb525 will not try to run aklog.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.I krb525
uses the following environment variable:
.TP "\w'.SM KRB5CCNAME\ \ 'u"
.SM KRB5CCNAME
Location of the default credentials (ticket) cache.
.SH FILES
.TP "\w'/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]\ \ 'u"
/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]
default credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).
.TP
/etc/krb5.keytab
default location for the local host's
.B keytab
file.
.SH SEE ALSO
krb525.conf(5), krb525d(8), kinit(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if the conversion succeeded or 1 if it failed.
.PP
The error messages printed by krb525 are intentionally vague to prevent a
hacker for gleaming too much information about the contents of your
krb525.conf file. (These error messages are actually returned as a
string from krb525d, so the client program itself just passes them on.)
