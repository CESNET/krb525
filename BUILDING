BUILDING KRB525
---------------

1) Run "./configure"

  krb525 uses an autoconf generated configure file. The first step is to
  run ./configure. One or more of the following options will probably be
  needed:

    --with-krb5=PATH

    Specify the path to the Kerberos 5 installation directory. Be default
    configure will look for the program kinit and use it's directory as
    the Kerberos 5 installation path.

    --without-k5-db-code

    Build without support for using the Kerberos 5 database
    directly. This means that the resulting daemon will only be able to
    use a keytab.

    --with-krb5-obj=PATH

    Specify path to the Kerberos 5 build directory. This is needed to
    build the krb525d daemon with support for using the Kerberos 5
    database directly.

    --with-krb5-src=PATH

    Specify path to the Kerberos 5 source directory. This is needed to
    build the krb525d daemon with support for using the Kerberos 5
    database directly.

    --with-intall-path=PATH

    Specify the install path for the krb525 client and daemon. This
    defaults to your Kerberos 5 install path.

    --with-afs-krb5

    Specify that you have the NRL AFS-KRB5 migration kit. (For information
    on the migration kit see: ftp://ftp.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/pub/kerberos5).
    By default configure will try to determine if you have the migration
    kit by looking for krb5_appdefault_boolean() in libkrb5.a.

  Run "configure --help" for a complete list of options.

2) Run "make"

  This should build the client, krb525, and the daemon, krb525d.

3) See the file INSTALLATION for installation directions.
