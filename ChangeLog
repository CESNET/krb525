	* server.c:
	more verbose messages; changed type of response status to char (to
	avoid problems with encoding integers on different architectures);
	added error table initialization

	* netio.c:
	removed htons(port) (this is done in krb5_getportbyname); now uses
	krb5_read,write_message instead of sending message length (not
	encoded! aarggh) and message data separately

	* krb525_convert.h: added port parameter

	* client.c:
	krb525_creds are now allocated dynamically; added port parameter to
	krb525_convert call

	* krb525_convert.c:
	added port parameter; replaced krb5_free_data with krb5_data_free;
	changed type of response into char; now returns error when received
	error response status from server

	* Makefile.am: now linking client with the library

	* krb525_convert.h, krb525_convert.c: added host list parameter

	* client.c: fixed bug in setting target server principal
	fixed bug in changing ccache owner (skip "FILE:" in cache name)

Thu Jul 29 14:45:20 1999  Michal Vocu  <michal@sal>

	* krb525_convert.h, krb525_convert.c: clean up

	* configure.in: added check for MIPS ABI

	* client.c: changed to use krb525_convert

	* Makefile.am:
	added krb525_convert.h to headers, added top_srcdir to includes

	* krb525_convert.h: added error message variable

	* krb525_convert.c: added error messages

	* netio.h, netio.c: Initial revision

	* krb525_convert.h: added krb525_creds parameter to krb525_convert

	* krb525_convert.c: added some meaning to the code

Wed Jul 28 13:35:53 1999  Michal Vocu  <michal@sal>

	* krb525_convert.c: it compiles now, but requires major cleanup

	* auth_con.h, auth_con.c: Initial revision

	* configure.in: added libtool check

	* Makefile.am: added libkrb525.la library

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, srv_conf.h, srv_conf.c, server.h, server.c, krb525_convert.h, krb525.h, h_db.h, h_db.c, client.c, acconfig.h, krb525_convert.c:
	Initial revision

	* server.c: progname was not getting set correctly. Use progname
	in call to setup_auth_context() to be consistant with client.

	* client.c: progname was not getting set correctly. Fixed bug in
	call to setup_auth_context() that caused failures with clients with
	instances in their names. 

	* auth_con.c (setup_auth_context): Use sin_port and not sin_addr
	in call to krb5_gen_portaddr(). This keeps us from having cache
	conflicts when krb525 and krb525d are running on the same machine.

Tue Oct  7 09:43:39 1997  Von Welch  <vwelch@computer.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

	* client.c (get_creds_with_keytab, get_creds_with_ccache): 
	Added options to passed arguments. Changed callers.
	Code will not make tickets from keytab forwardable.

	* ChangeLog: Created ChangeLog file.

	* client.c [AFS_KRB5]: Added exec of aklog

	* acconfig.h: Added AFS_KRB5

	* configure.in: Check for using AFS-KRB5 migration kit and define
	AFS_KRB5 in config.h if we are.
