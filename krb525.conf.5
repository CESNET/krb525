.TH KRB525.CONF 5
.SH NAME
krb525.conf \- Kerberos krb525d daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb525d.conf
contains configuration information needed by the krb525d(8) daemon. This
includes access control information in regards to ticket conversion it
is allowd to perform. In is normally localed in the
.B etc
directory under the Kerberos 5 install directory (e.g.
.BR /krb5/etc/krb5.conf )
.PP
The 
.I krb525.conf
file uses the following format:
.sp
.nf
.in +1i
item1 = value1 ;
item2 item3 = value2 ;
item4 item5 = value3 value4 value 5 ;

item6 = {
	subitem1 = subvalue1 subvalue2 ;
	subitem2 = subvalue3 ;
}

item7 item8 = {
	subitem1 = subvalue1 ;
}
.in -1i
.fi
.sp
All strings and special characters (
.BR = ,
.BR { ,
.BR } ,
.B ;
) must be delimited by whitespace or a carriage return. The wildcard
characters 
.B *
and 
.B ?
are recognized and used as in the Unix csh. Any principal names
without a realm name are assumed to be in the default realm. A pound
character (
.B #
) denotes a comment and causes all further text up to a carriage
return to be ignored.
.PP
The following items are currently used in the 
.I krb525.conf
file:
.IP allowed_clients
This item should be followed by a list of values which are the names
of the client principals allowed to connect and use the krb525d
services.

.IP client_mappings
This items should be followed by a list of "<client> = <target client>
;" mappings. These represent legal conversions of clients that the
krb525d daemon may perform in a ticket.

.IP server_mappings
This items should be followed by a list of "<service> = <target
service> ;" mappings. These represent legal conversions of services
that the krb525d daemon may perform in a ticket.

.IP allowed_hosts
This item should be followed by a list of values which are the names
of hosts from which connections may be made to the krb525d
daemon. These names may be either the IP dot address (e.g. 10.0.0.1)
or the full hostname (e.g. some.host.net).

.PP 
In addition there may be listings of the form:
.sp
.nf
.in +1i
<client> = {
	capability = name1 ... ;
	target_clients = client1 client2 client3... ;
	target_servers = server1 server2 server3... ;
	client_mappings = {
	   <client> = <target_client> ;
        }
	server_mappings = {
	   <server> = <target_server> ;
        }
	allowed_hosts = host1 host2 host3... ;
}
.in -1i
.fi
.sp
Where
.B <client>
is a client principal name. This allows for a more
specific entry for a particular client. If such an entry exists for a
client then all other enteries are ignored when checking a request for
that client..
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.nf
#
# Example krb525.conf file
#
# Anything after a '#' is a comment
#

allowed_hosts =
	10.1.*
	*.somewhere.com
	somehost.domain.net
	;

allowed_clients =
	rsmith@OTHERDOMAIN.COM
	jtaylor@OTHERDOMAIN.COM
	joe
	john/admin
	;

client_mappings = {
	rsmith@OTHERDOMAIN.COM = roberts ;
	jtaylor@OTHERDOMAIN.COM = jtaylor ;
	joe = tapeadmin ;
}

john/admin = {
	target_clients = */foo ;
	allowed_hosts = adminhost.somewhere.com ;
}

.fi
.sp
In the above example the two principals
.BR joe ,
and
.B john/admin
in the local realm are allowed to connect to krb525d, plus the principals
.B rsmith 
and
.B jtaylor
from the realm
.BR OTHERDOMAIN.COM .
.PP
.B john/admin
has their own entry which allows their tickets to be converted to any
principal with an instance of 
.B foo.
They are also only allowed to make connections from the host 
.BR adminhost.somewhere.com .
.PP
The remainder of the users are allowed to connect from any host with
an IP address begining with "10.1.", from any host in the domain
somewhere.com or from the host somehost.domain.net.
.PP
The client_mappings section allows 
.B rsmith@OTHERDOMAIN.COM
and
.B jtaylor@OTHERDOMAIN.COM
to convert the clients in the Kerbeos tickets to those of the local principals
.B roberts
and
.B jtaylor
respectively. Assuming the cross-realm authentication is set up
between the local realm the the realm OTHERDOMAIN.COM and the
appropriate .k5login files are in place, this would allow these users
not only the ability to log into the local realm, but to use the
krb525(1) client to get tickets for the local principals. This can allow them
further access to systems that use Kerberos tickets, but do not
respect the .k5login file (e.g. the Andrew File System).
.PP
The user
.B joe
is allowed to convert the client on their tickets to the principal
.BR tapeadmin .
This can be useful if someone needs to have a ticket for a particular
principal but does not, for whatever reason, have the principal's
password or key.
